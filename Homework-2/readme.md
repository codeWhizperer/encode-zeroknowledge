It is not true that all odds squares are congruent to `1(mod 8)`

For example: 
The sqaure of the odd number 9 = 81. The expression `81 mod 8 = 1`, so 81 is congruent to `1(mod8)`

However, let's consider the odd number, 15 which is 225. The expression `225 mod 8 = 1`, so 225 is congruent to `1 (mod 8)`

<ul>
<li> O(n) refers to the complexity of an algorithm that grows linearly with the size of its input data. O(n) notation is used to describe the upper bound of the growth rate of an algorithm's running time as a function of the size of the input.</li>


<li>O(1) refers to a constant-time complexity, meaning that the running time of an algorithm does not grow as the size of the input grows. An algorithm with O(1) time complexity has a fixed running time, regardless of the size of the input.</li>


<li>O(log n) refers to a logarithmic time complexity, meaning that the running time of an algorithm grows logarithmically with the size of the input. An algorithm with O(log n) time complexity grows very slowly as the size of the input increases.</li>
</ul>

For a proof size, you would generally want O(1) time complexity, as it implies a fixed and constant running time. However, in practice, it's not always possible to achieve O(1) time complexity for all problems, and sometimes you may have to trade time complexity for other factors such as memory usage, ease of implementation, and so on.
