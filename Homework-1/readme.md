# Solution to assignment 1

# 1a.
Working with the set S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6} and the operation '+' as addition modulo 7, the result of 4 + 4 is equal 8(mod 7), which is equal to 1 in the set S.

    so, 4 + 4 = 1 in the set S with the operation '+' as addition modulo 7.

# 1b.

The result of 3 * 5 within the set S = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6},  can be found  by using the mod operator to reduce the result of the multiplication to an element within the set. In other words, (3 * 5) mod 7, which is equal to 15 mod 7 = 1.

    So, the result of 3 * 5 within the set S = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is 1

# 1c.

The inverse of 3 in the set S = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} with the operation '+' as addition modulo 7 is 4.

To find the inverse of an element a, we need to find an element b in S such that `a + b = b + a = 0 (mod 7)`. In this case, we can see that:

`3 + 4 = 7 = 0 (mod 7)`

So, the inverse of 3 is 4. This means that when 3 is combined with its inverse 4 using the operation '+' (mod 7), the result is the identity element 0.


# 2. 
Yes, we can consider   'S' and the operation '+' to be a group because it has the properties of a group such as associativity, identity and inverse

# 3. 

    -13 mod 5 = 2
    using the formular, n = qm + r; where 

    n = original number
    q = some number
    m = modular
    r = remainder

    -13 = ( - 7 * 5) + 2
    -13 = -13


# 4a.

# 4b.
The degree of the polynomial equation `x3 − x2 + 4x − 12` is 3
